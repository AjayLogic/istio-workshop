Note the navigation (reveal.js). The structure of the presentation takes advantage of nested sections. If you see arrows pointing Left or Right, you can navigate between major sections. Click the arrows Down or Up to dive into a section.

Note to myself: This is hosted using GH pages. I've set up a custom domain name and just need to push to the `gh-pages` branch of this repository. Nothing else needed to do (nothing with Jekyll, nothing with NodeJS/NPM), etc. Everything is written in HTML directly anyway, so no need to do anything, just push/merge to `gh-pages` when ready to go live!
